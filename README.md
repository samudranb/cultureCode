# Samudra's Culture Code

This is a shorthand articulation of the ideal company culture that I'd like to be a part of, or help create. This is always going to be a work in progress.

## What the processes should look like

```
function move(fast=true){

  experimentResults = articulateHypothesis().getData();

  if(youBrokeSomething == true){
    fix(fast);
    askForForgiveness();
  }
  else {

    lessons = synthesize(experimentResults);

    scaleUp();

    teachOthers(lessons);
  }
} ```

## What I care about

```
topicsWeCareAbout = [
  "impact", "making a dent in the universe",
  "design",
  "sociology",
  "user experience",
  "psychology",
  "lean"
]
```
